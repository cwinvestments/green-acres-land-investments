TECHNICAL HIGHLIGHTS
--------------------

PDF Generation Pattern:

Cloudinary Optimization Pattern:
- URL transformation: w_400,c_fill,q_auto,f_auto
- Reduces image payload by 60-80%
- Automatic WebP conversion when supported
- Lazy loading reduces initial page load

React Hooks Best Practices:
- useCallback for stable function references

- Strategic useEffect placement

Mobile Responsive Design:
- CSS media query: @media (max-width: 768px)

- Card-based layout for mobile
- All functionality preserved across devices

PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS
